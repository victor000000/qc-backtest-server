/// `backoff_factor` multiplier allows per-task 429 elasticity.
///
/// Tightened 2026-05-06: long-tail poll dropped from 2s -> 1s, near-completion
/// threshold lowered 0.80 -> 0.50. Typical 75s spec at 1s polls = 75 polls
/// vs 38 polls before, but cuts detection lag from ~2s to ~0.5s. With 10 slots
/// at 14 specs/min × 1.5s lag savings = ~30% of node-idle gap eliminated.
///
/// 2026-05-07 PM: `poll_count`=1 sleep 200-1200ms with jitter. Restart25
/// logged 221 `qc_poll_slow` events with p50 `read_ms`=9.3s on poll=1.
/// First fix (uniform 500ms) didn't help — restart26 still saw 50 slow
/// first-polls on 27 BTs. Root cause: slots create BTs in bursts (multiple
/// completing at once), so all first-polls fire synchronized 500ms later
/// and overload QC's backend with a read-burst on fresh BTs. Jitter
/// staggers them across an 800ms window, breaking the convoy.
