/// RAII guard for `session.active_collects`. Increments on construction,
/// decrements on drop (handles panic, cancellation, early return).
///
/// Semantics: `active_collects` counts backtests *currently executing on a
/// QC node* (= polling phase only). Decremented as soon as the poll loop
/// returns — at that point QC has marked the bt completed and the node is
/// free for the next backtest. Post-poll work (`collect_from_response`,
/// DB writes) does NOT count, since it doesn't hold a QC node.
///
/// Earlier version held the guard for the whole `poll_and_collect` task,
/// which made `active_collects` track total in-flight work (poll+collect).
/// That kept the backpressure cap pinned for ~100s after each bt finished,
/// blocking slot loops from creating new bts and leaving QC nodes idle for
/// 90+ second windows. See `release_after_poll` helper and `run_loop.rs`
/// backpressure block.
